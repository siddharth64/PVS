# PVS <br/>  
*A1*: <br/>

Proofs for 1 (b) are described as non-primitive proofs.

*A2*:                                                             
Reuploaded opsem, opsemwithstates4class and Majority since  in their earlier versions, the proofs were not verified properly because I exited PVS incorrectly. In opsem, for TCCs, the last proof (usually ending with -2) is my proof.
